I’m a biodiversity data scientist with a background in evolutionary ecology and conservation biology. In my current role as Decision Support Program Lead at the Atlas of Living Australia, I focus on streamlining reproducible workflows for accessing and analysing open biodiversity data. When I’m not coding or birdwatching, I enjoy creating art in R.
