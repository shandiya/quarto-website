I’m a biodiversity data scientist in Melbourne, Australia. I currently work as the Decision Support Lead at the Atlas of Living Australia, where I focus on streamlining reproducible pathways for accessing and analysing open data. When I’m not coding for work or looking at birds, I enjoy making art in R.
